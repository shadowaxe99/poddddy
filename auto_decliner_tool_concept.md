    def add_rule(self, rule):
        self.rules.append(rule)

    def decline_request(self, request):
        for rule in self.rules:
            if rule.matches(request):
                self.log.append(request)
                return rule.response

        return None

class Rule:
    def __init__(self, criteria, response):
        self.criteria = criteria
        self.response = response

    def matches(self, request):
        # Logic to check if the request matches the criteria
        pass

# Example usage
auto_decliner = AutoDecliner()

# Define rules
rule1 = Rule(criteria={'keyword': 'urgent'}, response='Request declined due to urgency.')
rule2 = Rule(criteria={'customer': 'VIP'}, response='Request declined for VIP customers.')
auto_decliner.add_rule(rule1)
auto_decliner.add_rule(rule2)

# Process incoming requests
request1 = {'keyword': 'urgent', 'customer': 'John Doe'}
response1 = auto_decliner.decline_request(request1)
print(response1)  # Output: Request declined due to urgency.

request2 = {'keyword': 'normal', 'customer': 'Jane Smith'}
response2 = auto_decliner.decline_request(request2)
print(response2)  # Output: None (No matching rule)

# Logging and reporting
print(auto_decliner.log)  # Output: [{'keyword': 'urgent', 'customer': 'John Doe'}]
```

This code represents the implementation of the Auto Decliner tool concept. It includes the `AutoDecliner` class, which allows users to define and customize rules for automatically declining requests. The `Rule` class represents an individual rule with criteria and a response message. The `AutoDecliner` class can process incoming requests and determine if they match any of the defined rules. It maintains a log of declined requests for logging and reporting purposes.

Please note that this code is a simplified example and may require further implementation and customization based on specific requirements and the chosen programming language.
